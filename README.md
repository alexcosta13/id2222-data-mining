Assignments for ID2222 Data Mining course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

## Lab 1
The goal of this assignment is to implement the stages of finding textually similar documents based on Jaccard similarity using the shingling, MinHashing, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques and corresponding algorithms. Furthermore, we also evaluate and compare the different techniques in a small corpus of 10 documents. This assignment is implemented in Python.

## Lab 2
The goal of this assignment is to implement the A-Priori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets with support at least *s* in a dataset of sales transactions. Then, to develop and implement an algorithm for generating association rules between frequent itemsets discovered by using the A-Priori algorithm in a dataset of sales transactions. This assignment is implemented in Python.

## Lab 3
The goal of this assignment is to implement the reservoir sampling algorithm presented in the paper "[TRIÈST: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully-Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3059194)", by Stefani et al. This assignment is implemented in Python.

## Lab 4
The goal of this assignment is to implement and test the spectral graph clustering algorithm described in the paper “[On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2001/hash/801272ee79cfde7fa5960571fee36b9b-Abstract.html)” by Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan and Yair Weis. This assignment is implemented in Python.

## Lab 5
The goal of this assignment is to understand distributed graph partitioning using gossip-based peer-to-peer techniques, such as JaBeJa described in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6676492). JaBeJa is a parellel algorithm that uses simulated annealing techniques for graph partitioning. It does not need central coordination, only the direct neighbors and a small set of the random nodes of the graph need to be local. This assignment is implemented in Java.
